      <h1>About Mountains to Sea Therapy</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Abby Teed (she/her), LCSW</strong>, a clinical social worker offering primarily online therapy for clients across North Carolina, with limited in-person home visits available after admission. Mountains to Sea Therapy reflects my move from the Midwest’s lakes and forests to the mountains and coastal waters of North Carolina — and the winding paths many of us take.

            The name <strong>Mountains to Sea Therapy</strong> reflects a journey that rarely moves in a straight line. There are seasons that feel like switchbacks on a trail and seasons that feel like standing in the surf, trying to keep your balance. My work is about creating a steady, compassionate space where all of that can be welcomed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve spent over a decade walking alongside children, teens, and families through foster care, adoption, in-home services, and outpatient therapy. Whether you’re a kid feeling misunderstood, a parent feeling stuck, or an adult trying to untangle old patterns, our time together is a place where you don’t have to perform. You get to be real, in your own way, at your own pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sessions are relaxed, collaborative, and body-aware. We’ll check in with your breath, muscles, and posture as much as your thoughts, using movement, tapping, or grounding exercises when helpful so your nervous system feels safer while we process hard things.
          </p>

        <h2>Deep experience helping families and individuals through their hardest seasons.</h2>
        <p>
          I've spent over a decade in the trenches—working in schools, clinics, and homes with families navigating foster care, adoption, trauma, and complex life transitions. That real-world experience combined with evidence-based training shapes every session.

            and “I feel less alone after every session.”

      <div class="values-grid">
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Curiosity over judgment</h3>
          <p>
            We slow down and observe instead of rushing toward a fix. Curiosity keeps us grounded in compassion and invites
            your story to unfold in its own words.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            Therapy is a partnership. I’ll offer education, regulation tools, and reflections, while also inviting your
            wisdom about what has or hasn’t helped before.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h3>Justice &amp; inclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Trauma is often tied to systems of oppression. My practice is LGBTQ+ affirming, fat-positive, anti-racist, and
            supportive of neurodivergent and disabled clients.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Outside of session</h3>
          <p>
            You’ll find me hiking coastal trails, exploring new coffee shops, reading memoirs, or tending to the plants I’ve
            promised to keep alive. These practices remind me to bring humor and humanity into the therapy room.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Community roots</h3>
          <p>
            I’m grateful to call Currituck County home and to serve clients across North Carolina through telehealth. The
            mountains and coast alike influence the metaphors, rhythms, and imagery that show up in our work.
