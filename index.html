      <h1>Therapy That Actually Works</h1>
      <p>
        You deserve a therapist who gets it. Someone who listens without judgment, who understands how trauma lives in your body, and who actually has the skills to help you heal. Abby has spent over a decade helping kids, teens, adults, and families find their way through the hardest seasons. She brings deep training in trauma-focused care, somatic therapy, and family systems work—combined with genuine warmth and real human connection.

        <h2>Therapy that heals your whole self.</h2>
        <p>
          This work isn't about quick fixes or surface-level coping. It's about understanding where you got stuck and how your body holds your story. Abby's clients say our sessions feel safe, real, and actually transformative.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card card-highlight">
          <h3>Grounded in your body</h3>
          <p>
            Trauma lives in your nervous system, not just your mind. We pay attention to what your body is telling us—the tightness, the breath, the patterns. Real healing happens when your whole system feels safe.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card-highlight">
          <h3>Big-picture thinking</h3>
          <p>
            Your relationships, your family's history, your patterns—they all matter. We don't just fix symptoms. We understand the landscape of your life and work with what's actually true for you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card-highlight">
          <h3>Real partnership</h3>
          <p>
            Therapy works best as collaboration. Your feedback shapes every session. Some weeks we go deep into processing; other weeks we build skills. You're never just a passive participant.
