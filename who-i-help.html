      <h1>Who I Help</h1>
      <p>
        Therapy is tailored to the person or family in front of me. Here are some of the people I most often support, and the concerns we can navigate together.
      </p>

          <h3>Children &amp; Preteens (5+)</h3>
          <p>
            For kids, therapy is playful, creative, and grounded in safety. We might talk, draw, move, or use sensory tools to help them express what’s going on inside.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Big feelings, meltdowns, or “out of nowhere” reactions</li>
            <li>School or peer struggles</li>
            <li>Grief, loss, or scary experiences</li>
            <li>Adoption, foster care, and family transitions</li>

          <h3>Teens &amp; Young Adults</h3>
          <p>
            Many teens and young adults show up carrying anxiety, people-pleasing, or a loud inner critic. We work together to untangle where those patterns started and what you want next.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anxiety, depression, and burnout</li>
            <li>Identity, relationships, and family conflict</li>
            <li>Trauma and PTSD</li>
            <li>School, work, and life transitions</li>

          <h3>Parents, Caregivers &amp; Families</h3>
          <p>
            Parenting is hard; parenting kids with trauma, neurodivergence, or complex behavior can feel impossible. We focus on connection, practical tools, and care for you as a person.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adoption and post-adoption support</li>
            <li>Behavioral and attachment challenges</li>
            <li>Co-parenting and family communication</li>
            <li>Support for caregivers who are exhausted and overwhelmed</li>

          <h3>Inclusive, affirming care</h3>
          <p>
            My practice is affirming for LGBTQ+ folks, diverse family structures, non-monogamous relationships, and people navigating faith shifts and cultural questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therapy is a shame-free zone. You don’t have to earn your way into being taken seriously here.
